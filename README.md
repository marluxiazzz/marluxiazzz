# Hey! Welcome to my GitHub page!

##  **A little about me..**
> My name is Tierra Haynes. I recently began programming to further both my education in technology, and keep up with the forever evolving world of technology. I first started in a medical class, lost on what I wanted to do. All my life people had been asking me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I never had a definitive answer. It wasn't until I began being more active with technology that I became interested in programming. I always had to have my older sister help me with things relating to technology, so I decided to finally learn so I can be independent when it comess to technology.


## **I'm currently working on..**
> I have been studying different codes, trying to understand them. I want to be able to make the exact game I had always looked for.


## **A little fun fact!**
> I am a big fan of RPGs, and visual novels. I love the Final Fantasy series, as well as Kingdom Hearts series, and I love Stardew Valley. I am also a fan of the Danganronpa games, as I love mysteries.
