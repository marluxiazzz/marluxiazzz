## Hey! My name is Tierra Haynes. I recently began programming to further both my education in technology, and keep up with the forever evolving world of technology.

I'm currently working on understanding the world of python, as well as studying the different strings and functions. I learn something new everytime, and I'm currently learning how to make my coding look neat, and work efficiently.
